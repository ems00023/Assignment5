## Home Page
The home page provides a welcome to the user. It shows an image of an airplane to let the viewers know what to expect. There is also a paragraph that was AI-generated to welcome the users to the website. Lastly, there are functional buttons that lead to other pages in the application. When it comes to style, it is all centered and has a blue-greyish theme.  Ella Southwell created this page.
## Search Page
The search page is where users can search for hotel pages. When the user is brought to this page, they will be prompted to search for a hotel by coordinates. The search from the coordinates will find a hotel within that area. Ella Southwell created this page using the spHotelSearchByRadius API.
## Climate Page
The climate page gives users the ability to check weather information. It uses the weather forecast API. The web page has a sky image background and a container storing weather information. Ella Southwell created this page and used the WeatherForecast API. 
## Review Page

## Ratings Page

## Hotel Information Page

## Destination Page

# Final Documentation
## Deployment guide
The first step in running the travel site application is to clone the repository [(https://github.com/BrookeMesinere4/Assignment-3-MIST-353.git)]. Once the repository is cloned into your blank VM, you will open SQL Studioâ€”once that is open, they will need to open the files  TravelDatabaseCreation.sql and TravelDatabaseDate.sql. Once you open the files, run it. Then, a database will be created. The next step would be to open the file TreyZontekSPS.sql and hit run. This creates the stored procedures for the application. You would want to do this step again for the files EllaSouthwellSPs.sql and BrookeMesinereSPs.sql. Next, you want to clone the repository [(https://github.com/ems00023/Assignment5.git)] to your blank VM. When complete, you want to open the project in visual studios. Then, ensure the start is configured to run both MIST353GroupProjectFranticFrogFirms and TravelSiteApplication. Once these steps are completed, the travel application should be up and running.

## API documentation
### WeatherForecast 
The weather forecast API generates the predicted weather forecast for a destination over five days. It gives the degree of weather in Celsius as well as Fahrenheit and summarizes what is to be expected. As of now, there are no inputs, but in the future, there will be an input of the destination the user wants to look at. The output would then be the weather forecast for that specific destination. The user can access this API by clicking on the "Go to Climate Page" button on the home page. Once the button is clicked, you will be brought to the forecasting page with the weather information. Ella Southwell implemented this API into the application.

### spHotelSearchByRadius
The Hotel Search By Radius API gives the user hotel coordinates. The user inputs the longitude and latitude. Once they are typed into the search button, the output would be the hotel within that radius. A user can access this API by clicking on the button "Go to Search Page" on the home page. Once the button is clicked, they will be brought to a page with a search bar to enter the required information and hit search. Ella Southwell implemented this API into the application.

## General description 
This application is designed to give users a new way to plan their travels. By making this application more focused on weather and climate, users can find the destinations they wish to visit based on their climate. It gives users access to hotel and climate information, making travel planning easier. The main hope of this application is to make travel easier.
## Developer documentation
As of now, this application is in the early stages of development. In the future, we plan to make this application more user-friendly by making it easier to use. Things we plan to do in the future include having an interactive destination page and adding search criteria for hotel features. Not all of our API's are prefected yet, but we continue to improve our design and make them more functional.
